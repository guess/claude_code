# ClaudeCode Elixir SDK Roadmap

## Current Status (Phase 4 Complete)

The ClaudeCode Elixir SDK is feature-complete with all core functionality implemented:

✅ **Phase 1-4 Complete**: MVP through full configuration support
- Session management with GenServer
- Synchronous and streaming query interfaces  
- Complete message type parsing (system, assistant, user, result)
- Content block handling (text, tool use, tool result)
- Streaming support with native Elixir streams
- Flattened options API with NimbleOptions validation
- Option precedence system (query > session > app config > defaults)

## Architecture Overview

The SDK provides an idiomatic Elixir interface to the Claude Code CLI with:
- GenServer-based session management
- Native streaming with backpressure handling
- Comprehensive options validation and CLI flag mapping
- Pattern matching support for all message types

## Future Enhancements

The following optional features could be added in future releases:

### Permission System
- Custom permission handler behaviours
- Built-in permission modes beyond the current `:permission_mode` options
- Interactive permission prompts

### Error Handling & Recovery  
- Structured error types with detailed context
- Automatic retry logic with backoff
- Rate limit handling and connection recovery

### Telemetry Integration
- Built-in observability with `:telemetry` events
- Performance metrics and token usage tracking
- Query lifecycle monitoring

### Supervision & Fault Tolerance ✅
- ✅ OTP supervision tree support (`ClaudeCode.Supervisor`)
- ✅ Named sessions with process registry (global, local, via)
- ✅ Automatic restart strategies and state recovery
- ✅ Dynamic session management (start/stop sessions at runtime)

### Advanced Features
- Session resumption and conversation management
- Connection pooling for high concurrency applications
- Pipeline composition helpers for complex workflows

### Testing & LiveView Support  
- Mock session utilities for testing
- Phoenix LiveView integration helpers
- Real-time streaming components

## Testing & Release Strategy

The SDK follows a comprehensive testing approach:
- **146+ tests** covering unit, integration, and property-based testing
- Mock CLI for predictable testing environments
- Real CLI integration tests when available
- Comprehensive documentation with doctests

## Next Steps for 1.0 Release

1. **Documentation Polish** - Ensure all modules have complete documentation
2. **Performance Testing** - Benchmark with large responses and concurrent sessions  
3. **Security Audit** - Review API key handling and subprocess security
4. **Community Feedback** - Gather input from early adopters
5. **Hex.pm Preparation** - Package metadata and publishing workflow
