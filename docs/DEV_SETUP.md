## Configuration Files

### `.formatter.exs`
- Configured with Styler plugin for enhanced formatting
- Set up for subdirectories and custom DSL support

### `.credo.exs`
- Strict mode enabled for high code quality standards
- Custom checks configured for Elixir best practices
- Max line length set to 120 characters

### `.dialyzer_ignore.exs`
- Ready for managing false positive warnings

### `.gitignore`
- Comprehensive exclusions for Elixir development
- Includes editor files, OS files, and environment variables

### `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Multi-version testing (Elixir 1.16/1.17, OTP 26/27)
- Runs formatting, credo, tests, and coverage
- Separate job for dialyzer analysis

## Mix Aliases

### `mix quality`
Runs all code quality checks:
- Compile with warnings as errors
- Format checking
- Credo strict mode
- Dialyzer

### `mix test.all`
Runs tests with coverage reporting:
- All tests with coverage
- HTML coverage report generation

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   mix deps.get
   ```

2. Run quality checks:
   ```bash
   mix quality
   ```

3. Run tests with coverage:
   ```bash
   mix test.all
   ```

4. Generate documentation:
   ```bash
   mix docs
   ```

5. Start interactive shell:
   ```bash
   iex -S mix
   ```

## VS Code Integration

For the best development experience, install these extensions:
- ElixirLS - Elixir language server
- Credo - Inline credo warnings

## Pre-commit Hooks (Optional)

To ensure code quality before commits:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
mix quality || exit 1
```

## Continuous Integration

The project uses GitHub Actions for CI. Every push and PR will:
- Check formatting
- Run Credo analysis
- Compile without warnings
- Run all tests
- Generate coverage reports
- Run Dialyzer

## Next Steps

With the development environment set up, you can:
1. Start implementing Phase 1 from the ROADMAP
2. Use TDD to build features incrementally
3. Ensure all changes pass `mix quality` before committing
